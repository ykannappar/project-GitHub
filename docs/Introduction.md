# Introduction to the GitHub REST API

**This documentation is designed specifically for beginners with no prior knowledge, providing an introduction to the purpose of the REST API, its features, and its benefits.**

 

## What is an API?

* Stands for "Application Programming Interface"

* Set of rules and protocols, which allows different software applications to communicate with each other.


## What is the GitHub REST API?

* The GitHub REST API allows clients (applications, users or services) to interact with GitHub's resources, such as its repositories, issues, users and more.

* The REST API uses **HTTP methods** such as: **GET**, **POST**, **PATCH**, **PUT** and **DELETE**, to retrieve or modify GitHub data.

* API responses are given in a structured format called **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation). This format makes it easy for clients to read and understand data.


## Why use GitHub's REST API?

* **To automate repetitive tasks**, such as creating repositories, without using the GitHub UI.

* **To fetch data** from GitHub, such as repository details, without using the GitHub UI.

* **To integrate GitHub with other tools**, where you can connect GitHub with other software automatically.
